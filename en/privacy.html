    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: December 09, 2025</p>

    <p>Mindful Breaker ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our application operates regarding your personal data.</p>

    <h2>1. No Data Collection (Local Only)</h2>
    <p>We believe your digital wellbeing is your private matter. <strong>Mindful Breaker does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.</strong></p>
    <p>All data generated by the app (usage statistics, history, settings, PIN codes) is stored locally on your device using Android's secure internal storage. If you uninstall the app, this data is permanently deleted.</p>

    <h2>2. Inventory of Installed Apps</h2>
    <p>To provide the core functionality of blocking distractions, the app needs to scan and list the applications installed on your device.</p>
    <p><strong>How we use it:</strong> We access your list of installed apps solely to display them to you, allowing you to select which apps you wish to block or limit. This list is processed locally on your device and is never uploaded to any server.</p>

    <h2>3. Disclosure of Accessibility Services API</h2>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Mindful Breaker uses the Android Accessibility Service API to function. This is the core permission required for the app to work.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Why do we use it?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>To detect which application is currently running in the foreground.</li>
        <li>To check if the running app is on your "Blocked List".</li>
        <li>To display a blocking screen or a mindful pause overlay when you exceed your limit.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>What we DO NOT do:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>We DO NOT read your emails, messages, or verify your passwords.</li>
        <li>We DO NOT change your settings without your permission.</li>
        <li>We DO NOT track your typing (keylogging).</li>
        <li>We DO NOT send any screen content to any server.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Children's Privacy (Kids Mode)</h2>
    <p>Our app includes a "Kids Mode" feature designed for parents. This mode allows setting a PIN code to prevent changing limits.</p>
    <p>The app does not collect personal information from children. The PIN code is stored locally on the device as a secure hash (encrypted) and is never transmitted.</p>

    <h2>5. Battery Optimization</h2>
    <p>To function correctly, the app may request to ignore battery optimizations. This is necessary to ensure the blocking service isn't killed by the Android system while you are using other apps.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
