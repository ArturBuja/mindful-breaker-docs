    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <p>Here you can find answers to common questions about Mindful Breaker.</p>

    <details>
        <summary>Why does the app need "Accessibility Permission"?</summary>
        <p>
            Think of the Accessibility Service as the "eyes" of Mindful Breaker. Without it, the app is blind - it cannot see that you just opened Instagram or TikTok. <br><br>
            We use this permission strictly to detect the package name of the app you are using to know when to show the timer or block screen. We do not read your text or private info.
        </p>

        <summary>What is the difference between Soft Mode and Hard Mode?</summary>
        <p>
            <strong>Soft Mode:</strong> It's a gentle nudge. When you reach your limit, we show you a breathing screen. You can choose to "Enter Consciously" and continue using the app. It relies on your willpower.<br><br>
            <strong>Hard Mode:</strong> It's a wall. When the limit is reached, the entry buttons disappear. The only way to enter is to use the "Emergency Unlock", which forces you to wait 60 seconds doing nothing. It breaks the dopamine loop.

    <details>
        <summary>The app stopped blocking unexpectedly. Why?</summary>
        <p>
            This is usually caused by your phone's "Battery Saver" or "Battery Optimization". Android loves to kill background apps to save power.<br><br>
            <strong>Fix:</strong> Go to Settings > Battery Optimization > Find Mindful Breaker > Select "Don't Optimize" (or "Unrestricted"). Also, ensure the notification permission is granted.
        </p>

    <details>
        <summary>I forgot my Kids Mode PIN. What now?</summary>
        <p>
            Since we don't store your data on servers, we cannot reset your PIN remotely. <br><br>
            To reset it, you must clear the app data in your Android Settings (Settings > Apps > Mindful Breaker > Storage > Clear Data) or reinstall the app. Note that this will also reset your usage statistics and streaks.
        </p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>How does the "Streak" (Fire icon) work?</summary>
        <p>
            The streak rewards your digital wellbeing. You get +1 to your streak if your total usage of blocked apps for the day is <strong>under 30 minutes</strong> (the scientifically recommended limit).<br><br>
            If you have set a custom limit (e.g., 60 mins), staying under that limit will also count!
