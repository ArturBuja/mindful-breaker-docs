    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <p>Here you can find answers to common questions about Mindful Breaker.</p>

    <details>
        <summary>Why does the app need "Accessibility Permission"?</summary>
        <p>
            Think of the Accessibility Service as the "eyes" of Mindful Breaker. Without it, the app is blind - it cannot see that you just opened Instagram or TikTok. <br><br>
            We use this permission strictly to detect the package name of the app you are using to know when to show the timer or block screen. We do not read your text or private info.
        </p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>What is the difference between Soft Mode and Hard Mode?</summary>
        <p>
            <strong>Soft Mode:</strong> It's a gentle nudge. When you reach your limit, we show you a breathing screen. You can choose to "Enter Consciously" and continue using the app. It relies on your willpower.<br><br>
            <strong>Hard Mode:</strong> It's a wall. When the limit is reached, the entry buttons disappear. The only way to enter is to use the "Emergency Unlock", which forces you to wait 60 seconds doing nothing. It breaks the dopamine loop.

        <summary>How do the Mindful Notifications work?</summary>
        <p>
            Instead of just blocking you at the end, Mindful Breaker helps you stay aware <i>during</i> usage. We send gentle notifications at specific intervals (e.g., after 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 minutes) of continuous use.<br><br>
            These serve as a "reality check" to remind you how much time has passed, helping you snap out of the scrolling loop before you lose an hour.
        </p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>What does "Today in apps" count?</summary>
        <p>
            This counter shows the total time you have spent today <strong>only in the apps you have added to your Block List</strong>. It does not track safe apps like Calculator or Phone.<br><br>
            The home screen <strong>Widget</strong> displays this exact same number, allowing you to check your daily consumption without opening the app.
        </p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>What counts as a "Session"?</summary>
        <p>
            A "session" is recorded every time you open a blocked app (or unlock the screen to use one). <br><br>
            If you switch from Instagram to TikTok, that counts as a new session. This metric helps you understand how often you impulsively reach for your phone ("Pickups").
        </p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>The app stopped blocking unexpectedly. Why?</summary>
        <p>
            This is usually caused by your phone's "Battery Saver" or "Battery Optimization". Android loves to kill background apps to save power.<br><br>
            <strong>Fix:</strong> Go to Settings > Battery Optimization > Find Mindful Breaker > Select "Don't Optimize" (or "Unrestricted"). Also, ensure the notification permission is granted.
        </p>

    <details>
        <summary>I forgot my Kids Mode PIN. What now?</summary>
        <p>
            Since we don't store your data on servers, we cannot reset your PIN remotely. <br><br>
            To reset it, you must clear the app data in your Android Settings (Settings > Apps > Mindful Breaker > Storage > Clear Data) or reinstall the app. Note that this will also reset your usage statistics and streaks.
        </p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>How does the "Streak" (Fire icon) work?</summary>
        <p>
            The streak is a prestigious reward for true digital wellbeing. Based on scientific research, limiting social media use to <strong>30 minutes per day</strong> significantly improves mental health.<br><br>
            Therefore, your streak increases (+1) <strong>ONLY</strong> if your total daily usage of blocked apps is <strong>under 30 minutes</strong>. <br><br>
            Even if your personal limit is set to 2 hours, the Streak requires you to meet the "Gold Standard" of 30 minutes to grow.
